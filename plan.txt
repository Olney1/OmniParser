Below is a high-level plan and a sample implementation outline showing how you might adapt this repository for extracting and comparing signature regions from PDF documents. You can adjust or expand these steps based on your specific needs. If anything remains unclear about OmniParser or the approach, feel free to ask for more details.
---
Plan Overview
Install and Configure the Environment
• Follow the instructions in the README.md of this repo to set up conda and install dependencies.
• Make sure you have a Python version compatible with the repository (the example shows Python 3.12).
• Install an external PDF-to-image library (e.g., PyMuPDF, pdf2image, or similar) so you can convert PDF pages into images.
Organize PDF Layout Definitions for Each File Type
Since you have five main PDF file types ("EERF", "PICI", "PIHC", "PIPS", and "PLID"), create a small Python data structure (e.g., dictionary) that keeps track of how to interpret or handle each PDF. For example, if you already know where the signature fields are in each layout (the bounding boxes, or approximate page location), you can store that in a dictionary for reference.
Alternatively, you could rely on OmniParser’s detection to find text/icon regions, then post-process or filter them to see if they look like signature fields.
Convert PDF Pages to Images
• Use a library such as PyMuPDF (fitz) or pdf2image to convert each page in your PDFs to a separate image file (e.g., PNG).
• For each PDF file in a specific folder, you will:
– Identify the PDF type by file naming convention (e.g., if the name starts with “EERF”, treat it as the “EERF” format).
– Convert each page in that PDF to an image.
Run OmniParser on Each Image
• For each page image, call the OmniParser detection functions (following the usage patterns shown in the README and the existing code) to detect elements on the screen.
• For signature detection:
– You can either compare the detected bounding boxes against your known "signature field" bounding boxes (for a given PDF layout).
– Or, if you have a custom prompt or rule for OmniParser's local semantics detection (e.g., searching for keywords like “sign” or “signature” from OCR text), you can filter the detection results that contain that text.
Aggregate and Compare Across Different PDFs
• Store the identified signatures for each PDF in a results structure or database.
• When you have “EERF” and “PICI” and so forth, you can cross-check if a signature (or a bounding box with an identical or near-identical signature snippet) appears in multiple PDFs. If yes, flag it for human-level checks.
• The matching can be done by text matching from OCR or by comparing bounding box images using an image hashing library—whichever meets your requirements.
Output the Flags/Report
• Summarize which PDFs have matching or duplicate signatures.
• Potentially produce an annotated image (or a PDF) that marks the suspected signature locations.

Sample Code
Below is a basic proof-of-concept script. It assumes:
• You have installed this repo’s dependencies (torch, easyocr, etc.).
• You have installed PyMuPDF (or some PDF-to-image library) for PDF conversion.
• You have a function or approach to decide which PDF layout type we’re dealing with (by filename).
• You have a data structure called “SIGNATURE_FIELDS” for each PDF layout type if needed.
Adjust as needed.
        "signature_boxes": [
)
Notes and Next Steps
• You may refine the “signature” detection logic by either:
– Hard-coding bounding boxes where the signature fields must be found (and checking if something’s detected in those bounding boxes).
– Or training a specialized model or applying textual filters (e.g., “signature”, “sign”) to the OCR text to ascertain whether a region is likely a signature.
• After each PDF is processed, you could store the bounding boxes (or extracted image patches) of each signature region. Then compare among different PDF sets to find identical or near-identical signatures as part of your “audit” requirement.
• The sample code primarily shows how to integrate PDF -> images -> OmniParser detection. You can expand it to address custom data flows or more robust signature matching.
